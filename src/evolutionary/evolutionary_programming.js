Evolutionary Programming: The objective of the Evolutionary Programming
algorithm is to maximize the suitability of a collection of candidate solutions
in the context of an objective function from the domain. This objective is
pursued by using an adaptive model with surrogates for the processes of evolution,
specifically hereditary (reproduction with variation) under competition.
The representation used for candidate solutions is directly assessable by
a cost or objective function from the domain.
Problem: Continuous function optimization; minimizing a cost function

Differential Evolution: The Differential Evolution algorithm involves
maintaining a population of candidate solutions subjected to iterations of
recombination, evaluation, and selection. The recombination approach involves
the creation of new candidate solution components based on the weighted
difference between two randomly selected population members added to a third
population member. This perturbs population members relative to the spread of
the broader population. In conjunction with selection, the perturbation
effect self-organizes the sampling of the problem space, bounding it to
known areas of interest.

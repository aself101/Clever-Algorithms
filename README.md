# ðŸ¤– Clever Algorithms by Dr. Jason Brownlee
A library for testing various nature inspired algorithms to solve different problem sets.
All code written in Javascript; to be executed within a Node/Browser environment.

## Motivation
This project was motivated by a desire to pick up machine learning algorithms as well as
learn the Ruby programming language by way of translation to Javascript. While several of
the following algorithms can be found in existing libraries and other code bases, building
the algorithm from scratch can serve as an excellent educational exercise. Some of the algorithms
contained are difficult to find and would effectively require reading through the original
white-paper or other academic journals that described them. Within the Clever Algorithms book,
all original code examples can be found written in the Ruby programming language.

## Installation

##### NodeJS
+ [NodeJS Homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/)
+ [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Current LTS v16.13.2

Recommendation is to install the Node Version Manager and install Nodejs through this version manager

From the command line(Linux/Mac):
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm
nvm install v16.13.2
```
## Problems
Each algorithm tackles a specific problem and can be extended to be applied to a variety
of situations. The problems tackled in the book are the following:

### Continuous Function Optimization
Seeking a minimum set of values given an objective function. See utils.js.
&#402;(x) where f = &#8721;<sub>i=1</sub>  -5.0 &#8924; x<sub>i</sub> &#8924; 5.0
